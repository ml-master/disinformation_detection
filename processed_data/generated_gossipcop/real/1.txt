Disney Princesses Ranked: From Most to Least Kick-Butt  Disney's iconic princesses have captured the hearts of children and adults alike, but not all of them are created equal. Some princesses are more badass than others, and we've ranked them from most to least kick-butt.  1. Mulan, Mulan  Mulan is no one's damsel in distress, which makes her the most kick-butt princess of them all. She joins the army and no one finds her suspicious, because she's just as good, if not better, than everyone else. Oh yeah, she also saves her entire country. NBD.  2. Anna, Frozen  Anna is goofy, outspoken, unstoppable, and totally relatable. When everyone feared the worst, Anna looked for a solution, and proved that sometimes the most important love is the love for your family.  3. Tiana, The Princess and the Frog  Tiana is the first and only princess who not only has a full-time job, but starts her own business, too! She proves that with hard work and determination, nothing, even turning into a frog, can stand in your way.  4. Pocahontas, Pocahontas  Yes, she made a sacrifice for love, but it was deeper than that. Pocahontas managed to create peace and understanding between two feuding groups. Plus, she can paint with all the colors of the wind, so there's that.  5. Belle, Beauty and the Beast  Belle is a small town girl who loves nothing more than to curl up with a good book. While she doesn't have magic powers or serious fighting skills like some of the other princesses, she manages to show the beast there's beauty in kindness. And unlike some of the other damsels on this list, she rescues her prince from an evil spell!  6. Elsa, Frozen  Elsa is the only other Disney princess (then queen) that has magical powers. Unfortunately, it takes her almost hurting her own sister to realize that being different can be good thing.  7. Jasmine, Aladdin  Our favorite thing about Jasmine is that her and Aladdin take turns rescuing each other. Still, girl can be super judge-y. We respect that she isn't "a prize to be won," but she doesn't give anyone a chance because she thinks all the princes are show-offsâ€”until someone shows up on a magic carpet, which sounds a little show off-y to us...  8. Merida, Brave  Merida gets props for wanting to do things her own way, and her bow and arrow skills give us a total Katniss vibe. Okay, so she did turn her mom into a bear and all, but she realized she was wrong and changed her back. That counts for something, right?  9. Cinderella, Cinderella  From her evil stepsisters to her even more evil stepmother, Cinderella just can't seem to catch a break. We sympathize with Cinders, but we wouldn't have blamed her for teaching her evil step siblings a lesson or two!  10. Sleeping Beauty, Sleeping Beauty  The most interesting thing about her is that she sleeps, for a really long time! The story's a bit of a snooze, literally.  11. Snow White, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  Snow White started the whole "I'll just rest my eyes until prince charming comes along" trend, which just prevents her, and the other damsels in distress, from living up to their full potential. Plus, lying around waiting for some dude to come rescue you? Lame! At least she taught us to never take food from strangers.  12. Ariel, The Little Mermaid  While we love Ariel's adventurous side, does it not bother anyone else how much she was willing to give up for Prince Eric? Meanwhile, he was ready to marry the first girl who sang him a pretty tune. It's time to reevaluate your life when the crab makes better decisions than you do!  13. Aurora, Sleeping Beauty  The most interesting thing about her is that she sleeps, for a really long time! The story's a bit of a snooze, literally.  14. Rapunzel, Tangled  Rapunzle spends the first 18 years of her life locked in a castle, and yet she still learned how to wield a weapon (a frying pan, but hey, it still counts!) like a trained professional.  15. Mulan, Mulan  Mulan is no one's damsel in distress, which makes her the most kick-butt princess of them all. She joins the army and no one finds her suspicious, because she's just as good, if not better, than everyone else. Oh yeah, she also saves her entire country. NBD.  What do you think of our ranking?
